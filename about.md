Hey! 

my name is Bruno, a Brazilian Engineer who is passionate about *learning* and *teaching*. I've started this website so I could share my solutions to a few of the [Project Euler's](https://projecteuler.net/) problems while forcing me to keep on improving my programming skills. The language of choie here is Python, but you may benefit from the website even if you are a *C#* or a *Ruby* programmer.

As described on Project Euler's website, *Project Euler is a series of challenging mathematical/computer programming problems that will require more than just mathematical insights to solve. Although mathematics will help you arrive at elegant and efficient methods, the use of a computer and programming skills will be required to solve most problems.*

**Important note:** if you are also working on the problems, make sure you come up with your own solutions (which you can verify through Project Euler's website) and only after that check other solutions on this website (or others). *Real learning is an active process and seeing how it is done is a long way from experiencing that epiphany of discovery.*

All the solutions to the problems have been created using a combo of [Jupyter notebooks](http://jupyter.org/) + [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/). You'll find a [Disqus](https://disqus.com/) chat at the end of each post. Feel free to reach me there or through [email](mailto:bru1987@gmail.com).
